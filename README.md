### Project
**Explore US Bike Share Data**

### Description
I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The tasks includes:
1. Importing the data to answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics:
    * Popular travel times
    * Popular stations and trips
    * Trip duration
    * User info
2. Writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics
    * Data for Chicago, New York, or Washington
    * Filter by month, day, or not at all
    * If they chose month: Which month
    * If they chose day:  Which day
    * Raw data preview option
    * Other city examination option

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
